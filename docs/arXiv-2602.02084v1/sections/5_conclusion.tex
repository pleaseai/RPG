\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we introduce \ours{}, transforming the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) into a unified representation for repository reasoning. By coupling dense semantics with topological constraints, \ours{} bridges architectural intent and implementation. Our evaluations show RPG is a superior navigational map for localization and a blueprint for reconstruction, achieving significantly higher fidelity than documentation. Furthermore, our incremental mechanism ensures consistency with lower overhead. Ultimately, \ours{} establishes a robust foundation for closed-loop software engineering by bidirectionally linking architectural intent with structural implementation.
